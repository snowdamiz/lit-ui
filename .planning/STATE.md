## Next Steps

### v3.1 Docs Dark Mode

Phase 25 roadmap complete. Ready for plan creation.

**Success criteria for Phase 25:**
1. User sees a theme toggle button in the header on every docs page
2. User can click toggle and entire docs site switches between light/dark immediately
3. User closes browser, reopens docs site later, and sees their previously selected theme
4. User with system dark mode preference visits docs for first time and sees dark theme
5. User on configurator page can use either the header toggle or configurator's mode toggle to switch docs theme (both stay in sync)

**Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 25`
