### Decisions

Key decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v3.0 decisions (pending validation):**
- Build-time theming over runtime — simpler, SSR-compatible
- URL-encoded token config — no server storage needed
- Theme generates into Tailwind CSS layer (not separate tokens file)
- OKLCH color space for perceptual uniformity
- lz-string compression for URL encoding
- Components already use CSS custom properties (no component changes needed)
