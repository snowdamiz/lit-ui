  <what-built>
Complete visual theme configurator with:
- Sidebar layout with color pickers, mode toggle, radius selector
- Live preview showing Button and Dialog components
- Get Command modal for CLI integration
- Light/dark mode editing with automatic derivation
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `cd apps/docs && pnpm dev`

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/configurator

3. Verify layout:
   - [ ] Sidebar appears on left with controls
   - [ ] Preview area on right shows components
   - [ ] Colors grouped: Brand (primary/secondary/destructive), Surface (background/foreground), Utility (muted)

4. Test color picker (pick any color, e.g., primary):
   - [ ] Saturation square responds to clicks/drags
   - [ ] Hue slider changes color family
   - [ ] Hex input updates picker when valid hex entered
   - [ ] Preview updates immediately when color changes

5. Test Tailwind swatches:
   - [ ] Swatches display (rows of color shades)
   - [ ] Clicking a swatch updates the current color picker

6. Test mode toggle:
   - [ ] "Light" and "Dark" options visible
   - [ ] Switching mode changes preview background
   - [ ] Color values may differ between modes (derived vs custom)

7. Test override/reset (while in dark mode):
   - [ ] Change a dark mode color manually
   - [ ] Reset icon appears on that color
   - [ ] Clicking reset restores derived value

8. Test radius selector:
   - [ ] sm/md/lg options visible
   - [ ] Selecting changes button/dialog border radius in preview

9. Test component preview:
   - [ ] Buttons show correct colors (primary, secondary, destructive, etc.)
   - [ ] Buttons are clickable (hover/active states work)
   - [ ] Dialog can be opened and closed
   - [ ] Dialog uses theme colors

10. Test Get Command:
    - [ ] "Get Command" button visible
    - [ ] Clicking opens modal
    - [ ] Modal shows npx command with encoded theme
    - [ ] Copy button works
    - [ ] Modal can be closed

11. General polish:
    - [ ] No console errors
    - [ ] Responsive enough for typical desktop
    - [ ] Transitions/animations feel smooth
