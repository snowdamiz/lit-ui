<objective>
Migrate docs and landing sites to apps/ directory as workspace packages.

Purpose: Integrate existing docs and landing sites into the monorepo workspace so they can be built/run via pnpm workspace commands. The docs site becomes the natural testbed for component packages.

Output: apps/docs/ and apps/landing/ directories with workspace-aware package.json files

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Move docs/ to apps/docs/</name>
  <files>apps/docs/package.json, apps/docs/vite.config.ts</files>
  <action>
Move the entire docs/ directory to apps/docs/:
```bash
mkdir -p apps
mv docs apps/docs
```

Update apps/docs/package.json:
1. Keep name: "lit-ui-docs"
2. Keep private: true
3. Keep all existing dependencies (react, react-router, lit, etc.)
4. Keep existing scripts (dev, build, preview)

Update apps/docs/vite.config.ts base path if needed:
- Check current base path setting
- Ensure it still works for GitHub Pages deployment

Remove apps/docs/node_modules and apps/docs/package-lock.json (will use root pnpm-lock.yaml):
```bash
rm -rf apps/docs/node_modules apps/docs/package-lock.json
```

The docs site should remain fully functional after this move.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `ls apps/docs/` and `cat apps/docs/package.json | head -5`</verify>
  <done>apps/docs/ exists with valid package.json, node_modules removed</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Move landing/ to apps/landing/</name>
  <files>apps/landing/package.json, apps/landing/vite.config.ts</files>
  <action>
Move the entire landing/ directory to apps/landing/:
```bash
mv landing apps/landing
```

Update apps/landing/package.json:
1. Keep name: "lit-ui-landing" (or update if different)
2. Ensure private: true
3. Keep all existing dependencies
4. Keep existing scripts (dev, build, preview)

Remove apps/landing/node_modules and apps/landing/package-lock.json:
```bash
rm -rf apps/landing/node_modules apps/landing/package-lock.json
```

The landing site should remain fully functional after this move.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `ls apps/landing/` and `cat apps/landing/package.json | head -5`</verify>
  <done>apps/landing/ exists with valid package.json, node_modules removed</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Remove examples/ directory</name>
  <files>examples/ (removed)</files>
  <action>
Per the context decisions, the docs app becomes the natural testbed, so examples/ is no longer needed.

Backup and remove:
```bash
# First confirm examples/ still exists
ls examples/

# Move to a backup location temporarily (can fully delete later)
mv examples examples.bak

# Or if confident, delete entirely:
# rm -rf examples
```

The React, Vue, and Svelte examples in examples/ are superseded by:
1. Framework verification done in v1.0
2. Docs site demonstrating component usage
3. Future SSR examples in Phase 17

Note: If user wants to preserve examples, can convert to apps/example-react, etc. later.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `ls -d examples* 2>/dev/null || echo "examples removed"`</verify>
  <done>examples/ directory removed or backed up</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:
1. Verify apps directory: `ls apps/`
2. Verify docs is there: `ls apps/docs/src/`
3. Verify landing is there: `ls apps/landing/src/`
4. Verify examples removed: `ls -d examples 2>/dev/null || echo "gone"`
5. Verify no nested node_modules: `ls apps/*/node_modules 2>/dev/null || echo "clean"`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- apps/docs/ contains the full docs site
- apps/landing/ contains the full landing site
- Both have package.json with private: true
- No node_modules or package-lock.json in app directories
- examples/ directory removed (or backed up)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/13-monorepo-infrastructure/13-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
