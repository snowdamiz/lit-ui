- [x] **DLG-08**: Reduced-motion support (prefers-reduced-motion)
- [x] **DLG-09**: Nested dialog support

### CLI

- [x] **CLI-01**: `npx lit-ui init` command for project setup

- [x] **CLI-03**: Build tool detection (Vite, Webpack, esbuild)
- [x] **CLI-04**: Component registry/list command

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Customization

- **CUST-01**: CSS custom properties API for explicit style overrides
- **CUST-02**: Headless/unstyled component variants

### Distribution

- **DIST-01**: NPM package mode (in addition to copy-source)
- **DIST-02**: Auto-update mechanism for installed components

### Components

- **COMP-01**: Input component with validation support
- **COMP-02**: Select/Dropdown component
- **COMP-03**: Tooltip component
- **COMP-04**: Checkbox/Radio components
- **COMP-05**: Card component

### Framework Verification

- **FWK-04**: Plain HTML verification (no framework)
- **FWK-05**: SSR compatibility (Declarative Shadow DOM)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Documentation site | v1 is MVP validation; docs come after concept proven |
| SSR compatibility | Complex, requires Declarative Shadow DOM; defer to v2+ |
| 40+ component parity | Start small, grow based on demand |
| CSS-in-JS runtime | Conflicts with Tailwind approach; performance overhead |
| React-specific features | Defeats framework-agnostic value proposition |
| Built-in state management | Conflicts with host framework's state management |
| Data components (Table, Chart) | Better served by specialized libraries |
