## E2E Flow Verification

| # | Flow | Status | Details |
|---|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | npm install | ✓ Complete | @lit-ui/accordion and @lit-ui/tabs packages built with correct exports, peer deps, types |
| 2 | CLI copy-source | ✓ Complete | Templates use standard `../../lib/lit-ui/tailwind-element` import (matches all 15+ existing components) |
| 3 | Documentation | ✓ Complete | Nav entries → routes → pages with interactive demos and API reference |
| 4 | Dark mode | ✓ Complete | CSS tokens defined in :root and .dark, consumed by both components |
| 5 | SSR | ✓ Complete | isServer guards on all browser APIs, Declarative Shadow DOM compatible |

## Anti-Patterns

No blocking anti-patterns found across any phase. All scans clean:
- Zero TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments
- Zero placeholder implementations
- Zero empty return statements
- Zero console.log-only handlers
- Zero unguarded browser APIs

## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated in v6.0 phases.

**Pre-existing tech debt (from earlier milestones, not v6.0):**
- 30 CLI tests need update for CSS variable naming change (from v3.0)
- CLI registry.json has incorrect time-picker→calendar dependency (from v4.3)

These items are not attributable to v6.0 and do not block milestone completion.
